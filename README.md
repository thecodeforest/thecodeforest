I'm a data scientist and researcher based in Portland, Oregon. I currently work in the retail sector leading a team that focuses on demand forecasting and inventory management. In my free time, I enjoy blogging and developing open-source software. Here are a few things I've done so far: 

- [Creator of the FantasyFootball python package](https://github.com/thecodeforest/fantasyfootball)
- [Creator of the Codeforest data science blog](https://www.thecodeforest.io/)

At present, my main interests are:

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data science
- :football: Fantasy Football
- :running: Running
